A modular robot:

About the Robot file we wrote in Chapter 7, how could we make that program modular?
The bindings are:
roads
buildGraph
roadGraph
VillageState
runRobot
randompick
randomRobot
mailRoute
routeRobot
findRoute
goalOrientedRobot

What modules would you create?
    Graph: --> remove and have dep on NPM dijkstrajs 
        buildGraph (export)
        findRoute
     Dep: None
    Road:
        roads
        roadGraph (export)
     Dep: Graph
    Village:
        VillageState (export)
        randompick --> remove and have dep on NPM random-item package
        runRobot (export)
     Dep: Road
    Robots:
        randomRobot (export)
        mailRoute
        routeRobot (export)
        goalOrientedRobot (export)
      Dep: dijkstrajs (goalOrientedRobot), Road


What modules are avaiable on NPM?
Graphs --> dijkstrajs
randompick --> random-item
